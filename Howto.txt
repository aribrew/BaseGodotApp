Tilemaps
---------------------------------------
Tilemaps are a bit tricky.

We first need a TileSetAtlas:

var tileset_source: TileSetAtlasSource = TileSetAtlasSource.new ()
tileset_source.texture = img_tex
tileset_source.texture_region_size = Vector2i (tile_w, tile_h)
tileset_source.create_tile (Vector2i (x, y))

Where:
- img_tex: ImageTexture containing our tiles
- tile_w, tile_h: The size of each tile
- create_tile (Vector2i (x, y)): Were, in our tileset, will be our new tile

Here a tileset_source can be seen as our tile 'palette'.


The next thing we need is a TileSet:

var tileset: TileSet = TileSet.new()
tileset.tile_size = Vector2i (tile_w, tile_h)
var tileset_source_id = tileset.add_source (tileset_source)

Attention: A TileSet isn't the same as a TileSetAtlasSource.
If the second can be seen as the 'tile palette', the TileSet can be seen
as a 'palette provider'.

Here we can add more than one 'palette' with 'add_source', and the function
will return an ID that we'll need soon.


The last thing we need, the TileMap itself:

var tilemap: TileMapLayer = TileMapLayer.new ()
tilemap.tile_set = tileset

This is the most simple thing as you see.


We now add our tilemap to our scene, and 'paint' in it:

add_child(tilemap)
tilemap.set_cell (Vector2i (0,0), tileset_source_id , Vector2i(0,0))

The set_cell requires basically 3 params:
- The first Vector2i are the Tilemap coords where we are painting.
- The second is the 'palette' ID to use, that we obtained before.
- The last one is the coords of tile we are using to paint.
